The repository provides two methods for generating routes based on user preferences (e.g., walking path, biking path) for wheelchair users using a multi-constrained path problem approach and a Q-learning A* approach.

**The Q-Learning A star approach is still under development**

The accessibility data for two neighbourhoods in Amsterdam are available: Osdorp-Midden and Nieuwmarkt.
